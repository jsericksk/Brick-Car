Game created just for fun, using [Canvas](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/graphics/draw/overview) in Jetpack Compose, inspired by the popular car racing game **"Brick Game"** .

The objective of the game is simply to dodge as many enemy cars as possible. The game controls are very simple:
- A tap on the screen changes the direction of your car;
- Holding the screen increases the speed of enemy cars and releasing it changes the direction of your car and normal speed is restored.
